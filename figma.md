Figma File Specification: Aura V1 Website

I. Global Design System: "Kinetic Minimalism"



This design philosophy merges the clean, corporate structure of Sola.ai with the minimalist, visionary, and emotionally resonant aesthetic of Linear and Arc. It should feel professional, futuristic, and intelligent. The "kinetic" aspect refers to the use of subtle, continuous motion to imply the proactive, always-on nature of the Aura agent.



Color Palette: Dark \& Focused



Primary Background (BG-Primary): #0D0D10 (A very dark, near-black with a hint of blue/purple, inspired by Linear).

Secondary Background (BG-Secondary): #1A1A1F (A slightly lighter dark grey for cards and content sections).

Primary Text \& Accents (Accent-Primary): #FFFFFF (Pure white for maximum contrast and readability).

Secondary Text (Accent-Secondary): #A0A0B0 (A light grey for sub-headlines and less important text).

Call-to-Action / "Magic" (CTA-Vibrant): #7D5FFF (A vibrant, energetic purple. This is the ONLY strong color and should be used sparingly for buttons, key highlights, and to represent Aura's "actions").

Borders \& Dividers: #2C2C34 (A subtle, dark grey).

Typography: Clean \& Confident



Font: Satoshi (by Indian Type Foundry) or Inter. A modern, geometric sans-serif is required.

H1 (Hero Headline): 72px, Bold. White (#FFFFFF).

H2 (Section Headlines): 48px, Medium. White (#FFFFFF).

H3 (Sub-Headlines/Card Titles): 24px, Medium. White (#FFFFFF).

Body / Paragraph: 16px, Regular. Light Grey (#A0A0B0).

Button Text: 16px, Medium. White (#FFFFFF).

Layout \& Spacing



Grid: 12-column grid with a max width of 1200px.

Spacing System: Use an 8pt grid. All margins, paddings, and component sizes should be multiples of 8 (e.g., 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 64px). This ensures visual consistency.

Iconography: Feather Icons or a similar minimalist, line-art style. Color: Light Grey (#A0A0B0).

II. Component Library (Reusable Elements)



Buttons

Primary CTA ("Join the Waitlist"): Solid fill (#7D5FFF). Text White (#FFFFFF). Subtle glow/shadow effect in the same color on hover.

Secondary: White 1px border (#FFFFFF). Transparent fill. Text White (#FFFFFF). On hover, fill becomes semi-transparent white.

Waitlist Form Input

A single text input field for email and a primary CTA button.

Style: Minimalist. No heavy borders. A simple bottom line (#2C2C34) that turns Vibrant Purple (#7D5FFF) on focus.

III. Page Blueprint: Section-by-Section Specification



Section 1: Hero



Inspiration: The mystery of Arc, the anticipation of Rabbit.

Layout: Centered, full-screen viewport.

Headline (H1): A short, provocative, manifesto-like statement. Example: "Stop managing your tools. Start directing your work."

Sub-headline (Body): One or two sentences explaining the concept. Example: "Aura is the proactive AI partner that executes your intent across every application."

CTA: The Waitlist Form Input.

Visual: NO LITERAL UI. A single, large, slowly evolving abstract animation in the background. Think a glowing orb, particle streams, or morphing geometric shapes. The animation should be subtle, continuous, and use the Vibrant Purple (#7D5FFF) to represent Aura's intelligence. It should feel like you are looking at a living, thinking entity.

Section 2: Social Proof (Adapted)



Inspiration: The credibility-building of Rabbit's investor logos.

Layout: A simple, centered bar below the fold.

Headline (H3, low contrast): "BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF WORLD-CLASS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY"

Visual: A row of 6-8 muted logos (color: #A0A0B0) of institutions (MIT), technologies (PyTorch), or research labs.

Section 3: Core Capabilities



Inspiration: The "magic" of RunwayML, the clean grid of Sola.ai.

Layout: A 2x2 grid of cards.

Headline (H2): "From Partner to Agent."

Card Content: Each card has an icon, a title (H3), and a short description (Body). Titles: "Proactive Guidance," "Agentic Execution," "Event-Based Memory," "Trust and Control."

Interactivity: On hover, the card's border glows Vibrant Purple (#7D5FFF), and the icon is replaced by a small, looping abstract animation representing the concept (e.g., "Proactive Guidance" shows a pathfinding animation).

Section 4: The Golden Thread Showcase



Inspiration: Linear's focus on a single, perfect workflow.

Layout: A three-step, full-width feature section with alternating text and visuals.

Headline (H2): "See The Golden Thread in Action."

Visuals: These are the most important assets. They should be highly polished, animated mockups.

Step 1 (Notice): Animation shows a user performing a repetitive task. A subtle purple glow appears, indicating Aura is watching.

Step 2 (Execute): The mouse moves on its own. The "live subtitle" element (a key visual) appears, typing out actions like "Creating folder 'Client XYZ'...". The animation should feel smooth, fast, and magical.

Step 3 (Guide): Animation shows the Avatar appearing as a minimal orb of light, transforming into a purple arrow to point at a specific UI element in an offline app.

Section 5: Detailed Feature Breakdown



Inspiration: The feature explanations of Sola.ai, but with the visual flair of RunwayML.

Layout: Alternating text/visual layout.

Content: Break down the components from the V1 document (Desktop Companion, Transparent Automation, etc.).

Visuals: Instead of static UI screenshots, use abstract visual metaphors.

"Rewind" Capability: An animation of a timeline being scrubbed back and forth.

Trust and Control: A visual of a shield with the "Awareness" toggle at its center.

Section 6: About Us \& Final CTA



Inspiration: The clean, professional team sections of Sola.ai and Linear.

Layout: Simple, centered content. Founder photos should be professional and in grayscale to match the aesthetic.

Final CTA: End with a large, centered headline (H2): "The future of work is not more tools. It's a better partner." Followed by the final Waitlist Form Input.
