\### \*\*Aura: The Focused Vision (V1 Synthesis)\*\* \*\*What Aura is\*\* \* A proactive AI partner that lives on your desktop. \* It understands your goal, watches your workflow, and speaks up when it can help. It then executes tasks for you—across both your online and offline apps—with full transparency. \*\*Core Promise\*\* \* Tell Aura your goal, like "Prepare my weekly sales report" or "Learn how to use this new software." It watches you work and offers to take over repetitive or difficult steps with one-click or hands-free execution. \* Aura can operate your computer for you, showing you exactly what it's doing with a live "subtitle" of its actions. If it can't safely automate a step, an on-screen avatar appears to guide you visually, transforming into an arrow to show you exactly where to click. \* When you want privacy, a single click stops Aura from watching your screen. It becomes a simple, fast chat assistant that only sees what you want it to. --- ### \*\*The User Experience\*\* Your entire interaction with Aura is designed to be simple and seamless, centered around a single, powerful workflow. \*\*The Golden Thread: From Goal to Completion\*\* 1. \*\*You Start Working:\*\* You open your apps—a spreadsheet, your CRM, a design tool—and begin a task. You've told Aura your goal is to "Onboard a new client." 2. \*\*Aura Notices a Pattern:\*\* Aura's \*\*"Awareness Mode"\*\* is on, and it sees you manually copying information from an email into three different places. It recognizes this repetition. 3. \*\*Aura Speaks Up:\*\* A friendly voice says, \*"I see you're copying the new client's details. I can finish this for you and create their project folder. Should I take over?"\* 4. \*\*You Agree:\*\* With a click or a voice command. 5. \*\*Aura Executes the Task:\*\* The mouse moves on its own. Aura opens your file explorer, creates a new folder with the client's name, navigates to your project management app, and pastes in the contact details. The whole time, a small subtitle window at the bottom of the screen reads: \*"Creating folder 'Client XYZ'..."\*, then \*"Pasting contact details into Asana..."\* 6. \*\*Aura Guides You:\*\* The workflow requires you to use a specific offline accounting app that Aura can't safely automate. The on-screen \*\*Avatar\*\* appears and says, \*"Now we need to create an invoice. Click the 'New Client' button here."\* The avatar transforms into an arrow pointing directly at the button. It guides you through the three required clicks. 7. \*\*The Task is Done:\*\* Aura confirms the goal is complete. What took you 15 minutes of repetitive work now takes 30 seconds. \*\*Desktop Interfaces\*\* \* \*\*1) Floating Companion (Glance):\*\* A minimal, always-available overlay. This is where you have quick chats and where Aura speaks to you from. It has one crucial toggle: \* \*\*Screen Awareness: On/Off.\*\* Toggling this off instantly puts Aura into privacy mode. \* \*\*2) Main Hub App (Deep-Dive):\*\* This is your mission control. \* \*\*Goal Management:\*\* Define, track, and review your high-level goals. \* \*\*History \& Rewind:\*\* A simple, searchable timeline of the screen snapshots Aura has taken. You can find a past moment by describing it ("show me the slide with the blue chart") to remember what you did or re-run a past automation. This history is the context that makes Aura so smart. \*\*Mobile Experience\*\* \* \*\*Floating Bubble:\*\* A simple, on-the-go version of Glance. Tap it to ask questions about what's on your screen. It remembers recent actions from your desktop, so you can ask, "What was the address I was just looking at on my laptop?" --- ### \*\*Core Capabilities (The Focused V1)\*\* \* \*\*Proactive Guidance:\*\* This is the heart of Aura. It watches for friction and repetition based on your stated goals and offers to help \*before you ask\*. It turns your AI from a tool into a teammate. \* \*\*Agentic Execution (Online and Offline):\*\* Aura operates your desktop apps (even offline ones) and browser with full transparency. \* \*\*Automation:\*\* Direct mouse and keyboard control with live "subtitles." \* \*\*Guided Assistance:\*\* When automation is impossible or unsafe, the on-screen avatar appears to provide step-by-step visual guidance. \* \*\*Event-Based Memory:\*\* Aura creates a lightweight, searchable history of your workflow using event-based snapshots instead of heavy video recording. This "Rewind" capability is the fuel for its proactive intelligence, providing all the necessary context with minimal impact on your computer's performance. \* \*\*Trust and Control:\*\* \* A single, clear \*\*"Awareness"\*\* toggle puts you in control of your privacy. \* \*\*App Blacklist:\*\* You can prevent Aura from ever seeing specific applications. \* Every automated action is explained with live subtitles and logged for your review. ### \*\*What We Don't Do (Deliberate Omissions for V1)\*\* \* \*\*No Meeting Recorders or Transcribers:\*\* Aura is not a meeting assistant. It is focused on \*your\* workflow and the tasks \*you\* perform. \* \*\*No Complex AI Model Settings:\*\* You don't need to be an AI expert. Aura uses the best model for the job automatically. There are no settings to manage. \* \*\*No Live Video/Audio Captioning:\*\* Aura does not process live audio streams. It is focused on your screen-based work. This focused approach ensures Aura V1 does one thing perfectly: \*\*it acts as your proactive, agentic partner to get your work done faster, across all of your applications.\*\*
