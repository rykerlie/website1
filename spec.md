1\. Technology Stack

Decision: Next.js (React).

Reasoning:

Performance: Next.js provides Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) out of the box. This ensures the marketing site is extremely fast and SEO-friendly, which is critical for a new venture.

Developer Experience: The framework's structure, routing, and component-based architecture (via React) will make development organized and scalable.

Ecosystem: The React ecosystem is vast, providing access to mature libraries for animations (Framer Motion), UI components, and testing. This is a low-risk, high-reward choice.

Styling: Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Its utility-first approach is highly efficient for translating a design system like the one we've specified into clean, consistent code.

2\. Animations

Decision: Implement using Framer Motion. Create placeholders ONLY if a specific animation proves too time-consuming for the initial launch deadline.

Reasoning:

Capability: Framer Motion is a production-ready animation library for React that is specifically designed to handle the complex, interactive animations we have specified. It is capable of implementing everything from the subtle hero background to the sequenced "Golden Thread" showcase.

Importance: The animations are not decorative; they are a core part of the user experience designed to convey the "magic" and intelligence of the Aura product. Implementing them with a proper library is non-negotiable for achieving the desired quality bar. CSS animations alone will be insufficient for the more complex sequences.

Implementation Plan:

Hero Background \& Card Hovers: Implement these first. They are essential for the site's "feel."

"Golden Thread" Showcase: This is the most complex piece. Build the static layout first, then layer in the animations. If this specific component delays the entire project, it is the only one that can be temporarily replaced with high-quality static images, but this is a fallback, not the primary plan.

3\. Asset Questions

Logos \& Images:

Social Proof Logos: Use the following 6 logos. Source high-quality SVG versions.

MIT

Stanford AI Lab (SAIL)

PyTorch

OpenAI (as a research entity)

Hugging Face

ArXiv

Founder Photos: Use professional, high-quality headshots. They will be converted to grayscale in CSS to match the site's aesthetic. \[PLACEHOLDER - You will need to provide the actual images].

Icons \& Visual Assets: The developer should use the Feather Icons library for all iconography. All abstract visual metaphors and animations (e.g., the hero background, the timeline scrub for "Rewind") are the responsibility of the developer to create using code (e.g., with particles.js, three.js for the hero, or custom SVG animations for smaller components) or source from a library, guided by the design specification.

4\. Content Details

Copy: Use the exact example copy provided in the figma.md specification for all headlines and descriptions. This copy has been chosen to match the intended visionary tone.

Founder Details: Use the following placeholder details.

Founder 1: Alex Grant, Co-Founder \& CEO

Founder 2: Dr. Lena Orin, Co-Founder \& CTO

Institution Logos: The list in question #3 is definitive.

5\. Scope Questions

Responsive Design: Full responsiveness is a mandatory requirement, not optional. The website must be pixel-perfect on desktop and provide a seamless, high-quality experience on both tablet and mobile devices. Prioritize desktop-first in the build process as the design is specified that way, but allocate sufficient time for mobile optimization.

Deployment:

Platform: Deploy to Vercel.

Setup: The Next.js project should be linked to a GitHub repository. Vercel will handle the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline, automatically deploying new versions on every push to the main branch. This is the standard, most efficient workflow.

Interactive Elements (Waitlist Form):

Decision: The form must be a fully functional, end-to-end email capture system. A static UI is not sufficient.

Implementation: Use a service like Resend or Loops for the backend. On form submission, the front-end will make an API call to a Next.js API route (/pages/api/subscribe.js). This route will then securely handle the logic of adding the email to your chosen email marketing service's list. This creates a professional user experience and begins building the waitlist asset immediately.

1\. Technical Setup Questions

Email Marketing Integration:



Decision: Use Loops.

Reasoning: Loops is designed specifically for modern tech companies and startups. Its developer-focused API and clean interface are a better fit for this project than a more general-purpose service.

API Keys: \[ACTION REQUIRED FROM YOU]. You will need to sign up for a Loops account and provide the API key. For now, I will proceed by building the integration with a placeholder environment variable (LOOPS\_API\_KEY). The functionality will be complete, pending the insertion of the real key.

Repository \& Deployment:



Repository: You (the user) should create a new, empty private repository on GitHub and grant me (the developer) collaborator access. Do not initialize it with a README or any other files. I will then push my local project to it. This ensures you are the owner of the repository from the start.

Domain: I will set up and deploy to Vercel's default subdomain (e.g., aura-website.vercel.app) initially. This allows for immediate review and testing. You can connect a custom domain later through the Vercel dashboard, a process that takes only a few minutes and does not require code changes.

2\. Content \& Assets Questions

Founder Information:



Decision: Use the provided placeholder details for now: Alex Grant (CEO) and Dr. Lena Orin (CTO).

Reasoning: This allows the layout and styling of the "About Us" section to be completed without delay. The names and photos can be replaced easily later via the codebase.

Photos: I will use high-quality, royalty-free placeholder headshots that will be converted to grayscale per the design spec.

Social Proof Logos:



Decision: I will source high-quality SVG versions of the specified logos myself.

Reasoning: Sourcing them myself ensures they are optimized for the web, have transparent backgrounds, and are visually consistent in terms of line weight and detail.

Product Details (Copy):



Decision: "Aura" and all product descriptions, headlines, and other copy provided in the documents are to be considered final and should be implemented exactly as written.

Reasoning: The copy has been deliberately crafted to establish the specific visionary tone required for the project. It is not placeholder content.

3\. Scope Confirmation

Animation Complexity:

Decision: Build the static version first, then layer animations progressively.

Reasoning: This is the most efficient and pragmatic workflow. It allows us to:

Validate the Core UX: Quickly establish and approve the layout, responsiveness, and content flow of the entire site.

De-risk the Project: Ensure a functional, high-quality static site is completed early in the process. This completed static site acts as a stable foundation.

Iterate on Polish: Treat the complex animations as a distinct second phase of work. This allows for focused effort on making them perfect without blocking the core site's completion. We can review and refine each animation individually after the main structure is in place.

1\. Repository \& Deployment Setup

GitHub Repository: Acknowledged. I will use the repository you have provided: https://github.com/rykerlie/website1/. I will require collaborator access to push code to this repository.



Loops API Key: Proceed with the placeholder integration for now. I confirm that I (the user) am responsible for creating the Loops account and providing the final API key before the final launch.



2\. Content \& Assets

Founder Information: Proceed with the placeholder founder information: Alex Grant, CEO \& Dr. Lena Orin, CTO. I will provide the actual founder details and professional photos for you to swap in before the final launch.



Social Proof Logos: The list (MIT, Stanford AI Lab, PyTorch, OpenAI, Hugging Face, ArXiv) is final. Proceed with sourcing high-quality SVG versions of these specific logos.



3\. Development Priorities

Development Order: You are correct to re-verify this. Use the recommended approach: Build the full static version first, then add animations progressively.



Critical Sections \& Animations: Yes, there is a priority order.



Most Critical for Launch: The Hero Section and the "Golden Thread" Showcase. These two sections carry the core of the visionary narrative. The static versions of these must be perfect.

Most Critical Animation: The Hero background animation. This is the first thing a visitor sees and is essential for establishing the "Kinetic Minimalism" aesthetic. If you are to focus on one animation early, it is this one. The "Golden Thread" animations can be layered in later, as they are more complex.

4\. Domain \& Deployment

Initial Deployment: Initially deploy to a Vercel subdomain (e.g., website1.vercel.app) for review. This is the most efficient process. I will handle connecting a custom domain once the site is approved for public launch.
1. Repository Setup
Decision: Initialize a new Next.js project locally first.
Reasoning: The correct workflow is to create the project on your local machine, and then, once the initial files are generated, connect and push it to the existing empty GitHub repository at https://github.com/rykerlie/website1/. Do not clone the empty repository first.
2. Current Workspace State
Decision: Start completely fresh.
Reasoning: To ensure a clean build with no conflicts, confirm the website1 directory is completely empty before you run the create-next-app command. If it contains any files, delete them.
3. API Keys & Environment
Decision: Set up the placeholder environment variable structure now.
Reasoning: It is best practice to code against the environment variable from the beginning. Create a .env.local file, add the line LOOPS_API_KEY='placeholder_for_development', and add .env.local to your .gitignore file immediately. I will provide the actual key later.
4. Asset Sourcing
Decision: Proceed with finding high-quality SVG versions.
Reasoning: You are correct to source them. The only brand guideline is to use the official, single-color or monochrome versions of the logos whenever possible. They will be rendered in a muted color (#A0A0B0) on the site, so complex, multi-color logos should be avoided to maintain the minimalist aesthetic.
5. Development Approach
Decision: Yes, that is the correct approach. Create that todo list.
Reasoning: Your proposed plan perfectly aligns with the project's priorities. The sequence you outlined is the exact order of operations to follow:
Static layout and responsive design.
Core functionality (waitlist form integration with the placeholder key).
Basic styling and typography.
Progressive animation enhancement (starting with the Hero background).
6. Deployment Timeline
Decision: Set up the Vercel deployment immediately after the initial build.
Reasoning: Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel as soon as you have pushed the initial commit. This "deploy early, deploy often" strategy confirms that the CI/CD pipeline is working from day one and de-risks the project. You will deploy the boilerplate Next.js app first, and every subsequent push will update the Vercel deployment.
